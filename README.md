# Understanding-Random-Forests
Material for a Staff to Staff training on Decision Trees and Random Forests

Contains three jupyter notebooks on:
- Understanding Split metrics such as Weighted Gini Index or Entropy vs Classification Error
- Visualizing how Decision Trees partition a 2D space, and the effects of their high variance (mostly cloned by https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2015)
- Using Random Forest and its tools on a simple classification task (partly reuses some sklearn documentation)

Packages used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- ipywidgets
- tqdm
- warnings
- fig_code (download from this repository)
